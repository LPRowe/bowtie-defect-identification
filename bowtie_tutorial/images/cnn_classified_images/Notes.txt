Every bowtie has three images associated with it.

There are a few ways we can feed an image like this to a CNN.

We could stack the shear0, shear45, and Light images like they were different color channels (R, G, B)
then use a 3D kernel.  This approach is recommended because it makes it easier for the model to 
see the relationship between pixel (i, j) in the shear0 image and pixel (i, j) in the shear 45 image.

However, for the sake of simplicity, the shear 0 and shear 45 images were stacked side by side to form
an image with dimensions (16 by 8) and 2D kernels were used along with batch normalization.  

The resulting input images are shown in this folder.  

I skipped over a ton of details here, but if you are interested in CNN's or just machine learning in general, I highly recommend Aurelien Geron's book Hands On Machine Learning the Second Edition.
